<h1>MVC Routing Lab</h1>

<p>Add folders, controllers, and actions as needed to complete the following
    routes. All of these links will display "404 Page Not Found" until you
    create the corresponding routes.</p>

<ul>
    <?php foreach ($exercises as $route): ?>
    <li><a href="<?=$route?>"><?=$route?></a></li>
    <?php endforeach; ?>
</ul>

<p>If you finish this early, help your neighbors. If your neighbors finish
    early, make them help you. Bribe them with pizza if necessary. They may
    have forgotten that it's free.</p>
